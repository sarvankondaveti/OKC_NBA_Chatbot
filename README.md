üèÄ **Excited to share my latest AI project: Building an End-to-End RAG Pipeline for NBA Analytics!**

I recently completed a comprehensive technical project where I developed an AI-powered chatbot system for NBA game analysis using advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. Here's what I built:

## üöÄ **Technical Architecture & Implementation:**

**Backend Infrastructure:**
‚Ä¢ **PostgreSQL + pgvector**: Implemented vector database for semantic search across 36,000+ player performances
‚Ä¢ **FastAPI**: Built robust REST API with intelligent query routing (player vs game-specific questions)
‚Ä¢ **Ollama Integration**: Leveraged `nomic-embed-text` (768-dim embeddings) + `llama3.2:3b` for LLM inference
‚Ä¢ **Docker Orchestration**: Full containerized deployment with multi-service architecture

**Advanced RAG Pipeline:**
‚Ä¢ **Hybrid Search Strategy**: Combined semantic similarity with structured SQL queries for optimal retrieval
‚Ä¢ **Smart Query Routing**: Implemented keyword-based classification to route questions to appropriate data sources
‚Ä¢ **Embedding Optimization**: Achieved 100% coverage across all player performances with carefully crafted text serialization
‚Ä¢ **Performance Tuning**: Optimized LLM parameters for 20-25 second response times (reduced from 45+ seconds)

**Frontend Development:**
‚Ä¢ **Angular 15**: Built responsive chat interface with real-time messaging
‚Ä¢ **UX Optimization**: Implemented loading states, error handling, and evidence display for transparency
‚Ä¢ **Cross-Origin Integration**: Seamless frontend-backend communication with CORS configuration

## üìä **Data Processing & Analytics:**

**Dataset Scope:**
‚Ä¢ Processed Western Conference NBA games (2023-25 seasons)
‚Ä¢ Ingested 4 CSV files: game_details, player_box_scores, players, teams
‚Ä¢ Generated embeddings for complex game scenarios and player statistics

**Key Challenges Solved:**
‚Ä¢ **Data Coverage**: Handled missing data scenarios with clear error messaging
‚Ä¢ **Semantic Search**: Designed text representations that capture both context and factual information
‚Ä¢ **Query Complexity**: Built system to handle diverse question types (scores, player stats, team records)

## üéØ **Technical Achievements:**

‚úÖ **70% Success Rate** on complex NBA questions
‚úÖ **Real-time Chat Interface** with evidence-based responses  
‚úÖ **Scalable Architecture** supporting 36K+ embedded records
‚úÖ **Production-Ready** with comprehensive error handling
‚úÖ **Clean Codebase** following best practices

## üß† **Advanced Features Implemented:**

‚Ä¢ **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic detection of player vs game-specific queries
‚Ä¢ **Evidence Tracking**: Every response includes source data references
‚Ä¢ **Performance Monitoring**: Optimized for both accuracy and speed
‚Ä¢ **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns across data, embedding, and retrieval layers

## üí° **Technical Learning & Growth:**

This project deepened my understanding of:
‚Ä¢ Vector databases and semantic search optimization
‚Ä¢ RAG pipeline design and prompt engineering
‚Ä¢ Full-stack AI application development
‚Ä¢ Performance optimization in production environments

## üîÆ **Future Enhancements:**

‚Ä¢ Fine-tuning embedding models for basketball domain
‚Ä¢ Real-time data streaming integration
‚Ä¢ Advanced analytics dashboard
‚Ä¢ Multi-modal data processing (video + text)

**Technologies Used:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, pgvector, Ollama, Angular, TypeScript, Docker, SQLAlchemy, Pandas

This project showcases the power of combining traditional databases with modern AI techniques to create intelligent, data-driven solutions for sports analytics. The system demonstrates how RAG can be effectively applied to domain-specific knowledge bases for accurate, evidence-based responses.
